## Final Project - Last Minute Guidelines

These notes are in addition to the notes I have sent you before, and that are also accessible in [final-project.pdf](final-project.pdf). Some of the stuff below is repeated from the final project pdf in the link above.


### Due date and delivery method

I have changed the due date a bit. Originally the due date was Sunday May 5th, but I will give you one extra day to deliver the repository and another extra day to deliver the final report up. So we have:

- Monday May 6th, anwhere on earth. Send us a link to your GitHub repository. This should be a repository dedicated to your project and nothing else. It should also include the final report. If it is private repository, make sure Yangyang (Brendayy) and I (marcverhagen) have access. When we get the link we will clone your repository.

- Tuesday May 7th, anywhere on earth. If you have made updates to your final report, let us know and send us a pdf via email, if you don't do this we will assume that the report in the repository that we cloned is the final one.

As noted above, you should deliver a Github repository with everything in it, except potentially for very large models that your code needs to run, for those cases you need to document how to get those models.

Technically, the repository you give us on Monday does not need to have the final report if you choose to do all your writing on Tuesday, but I suggest strongly that you put at least a somewhat amended version of you 2-4 page project plan in there.


### Write up details

There are two write ups: the top-level readme file and the report. These two serve different purposes and the content should reflect that.

**README.md**

This file should be at the top-level of your repository and tell us how to use your code, this includes:

- instructions on how to install and requirements
- instructions on how to get items that are not in the repository
- if we need to access some API, instructions on how to access it in case passwords are needed
- instructions on how to run the tests you have included

In general, the smoother you make it for us to use your code the higher we will think of your readme file.

**Report**

This is an overview on what you did, how you did it and why you did it, see also pages 4-7 in [final-project.pdf](final-project.pdf). This report is NOT the same as the 2-4 page project plan that you wrote earlier, but much of what you had in that document will most likely end up in your report.

The experience from previous years is that it will take about 5-10 pages to write a report that is informative. And that is 5-10 real pages, not pages with large margins and double line spacing.
