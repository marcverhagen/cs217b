# Flask exercise

Make sure this works for you:

```bash
pip instal flask flask-restful
python calc1.py
```

Resource to use: [calc1.py](calc1.py).

Your site will run at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Changes to make:

- Use templates.
- Use a style sheet.
- Better caclulator.
- Display the input in the result.
- Use flask-restful with explicit resources.

Resources for the improvements:

- [main.css](main.css) (in case you are shaky on creating stylesheets)
- [index2.html](index2.html) (in case you are shaky on HTML form elements)
