# Threads and other asynchronous programming

This directory has a couple of examples of asynchronous programming:

- await1.py through await6.py show examples of using asyncio
- example1.py through example4.py have threading examples
- fastapi-async have a few examples in the context of a REST API

At some point I want to add something on timeouts, perhaps based on 
[https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-python/python-timeouts/](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-python/python-timeouts/), which has a section on timeouts in asyncio, but also includes sections on HTTP requests and database operations (the latter not including SQLite though).
