# Calculator example

This directory starts with an extremely simplistic calculator in [calc1.py](calc1.py). It can only take one number and multiply it by 10. The code is also very simplistic, it just returns the HTML straight from the method associated with a resource.

Then there are five new scripts that give examples of some features of Flask: templates, stylesheets, and flask-restful. There are incremental changes that do the following:

1. Push the HTML into templates.
2. Hook up a style sheet to the template.
3. Create real multiplication and add addition.
4. Display the full equation in the result.
5. Use flask-restful.
