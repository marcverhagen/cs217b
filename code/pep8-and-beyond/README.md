# PEP8 and beyond

This directory contains some annotated and expanded code that was used towards the end of the presentation by Raymond Hettinger at PyCon 2015 ([youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)). The presentation was named *Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code* and goes into the pitfalls of using pep8 too zealously.
